## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r import-data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
raw_df <-
  list.files(path = ".", pattern = "*.csv") |> 
  map_df(~read_csv(.))
```

```{r filter results}
raw_df |> 
  group_by(tourney_id) |> 
  filter(match_num == max(match_num)) |> 
  group_by(tourney_name, winner_id, winner_name) |> 
  summarize(count = n()) |> 
  arrange(desc(count))
```
